 ## Wulff Studios Website

 *This is the source code to the website. I am mostly familiar with game development and web development front-end is
 quite a different world in comparison. I looked at lots of different technologies and found a way to keep it simple, but effective!
 I am using the following as the development stack:*

* 11ty

* Tailwind CSS

* Node.js
